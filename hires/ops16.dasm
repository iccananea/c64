  ; inc16 is a macro used to increment 16 bit numbers.
  ; ARGS:
  ;  1 - The base address where the number is stored.
  MAC inc16
    inc {1}
    ldx {1}
    cpx #$00
    bne .end
    inc {1}+1
.end:
  ENDM

  ; cmp16 compares two 16 bit numbers.
  ; ARGS:
  ;  1 - Base address of first number.
  ;  2 - Base address of second number.
  MAC cmp16
    ; First, compare the MSB of both numbers.
    lda {1}+1
    cmp {2}+1
    bne .end

    ; MSB is equal, compare LSB.
    lda {1}
    cmp {2}
